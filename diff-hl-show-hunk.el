;; URL:      https://github.com/alvarogonzalezsotillo/diff-hl-show-hunk.
;; Keywords: vc, diff, diff-hl, popup
;; Version:  1.0
;; Package-Requires: ((diff-hl "1.8.7"))

;;; Commentary:

;; `diff-hl-show-hunk' shows a posframe/popup with the modified hunk
;; at point.  `diff-hl-show-hunk-function' contains the backend used
;; to show the hunk.  By default, it tries to use
;; `diff-hl-show-hunk-posframe' (GUI), and then
;; `diff-hl-show-hunk-popup'.  It fallbacks to `diff-hl-diff-goto-hunk'
;; if there is not a `diff-hl-show-hunk-function' defined.

;; `diff-hl-show-hunk-mode' shows the posframe/popup when clicking
;; in the margin or the fringe.

;;
;; To use it in all buffers:
;;
;; (global-diff-hl-show-hunk-mode)
